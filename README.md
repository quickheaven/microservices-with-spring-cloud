# Microservices with Spring Cloud
A deep-dive into the Microservice architectural style, and how to implement it with Spring technologies. (September 2024)

## What are Microservices
Best describe as:
* An architectural style
* An alternative to more traditional 'monolithic' applications
* Decomposition of single system into a suite of small services, each running as independent processes and intercommunicating via open protocols.
* Fine Grained SOA - Adrian Cockroft (Netflix)
